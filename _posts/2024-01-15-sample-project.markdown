detailed_description: "Developed a comprehensive image classification system using deep learning techniques to automatically categorize images into 10 different classes. The system achieved 94% accuracy on the test dataset and includes a user-friendly web interface for real-time predictions."
creation_process: "The project began with extensive data preprocessing and augmentation to improve model robustness. I experimented with different CNN architectures including ResNet, VGG, and custom models. After hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, I deployed the best model using Flask and created an interactive web interface with real-time prediction capabilities."
