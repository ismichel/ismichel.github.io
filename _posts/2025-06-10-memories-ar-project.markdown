detailed_description: "Developed an  augmented reality system using Snap's Spectacles that allows users to create and revisit immersive, location-based memory experiences. The project explores how AR can deepen our connection to personal memories by anchoring them to physical spaces, enabling users to 'walk back into' meaningful moments from their past."
creation_process: "The project began with extensive needfinding interviews to understand how people relate to memory and place. We discovered that memory is more than recollectionâ€”it's relocation. People want to return to the feeling of a moment, and location is often the strongest trigger for emotional transport. We prototyped multiple iterations: starting with VR memory sharing, exploring AR gifting concepts, and finally developing a location-based AR system using Snap's Lens Studio. Despite technical challenges with Custom Locations, we successfully pivoted to Image Marker recognition to create a working prototype that anchored memories to specific visual markers in real-world spaces."
