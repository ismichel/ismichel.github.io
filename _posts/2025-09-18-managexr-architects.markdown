detailed_description: "ElectriGuide is an AI-powered mobile application that transforms how electricians learn and work. Our intelligent assistant provides step-by-step guidance through complex installations, analyzes work progress via photo verification, and delivers real-time feedback to ensure precision and safety. The app addresses the critical shortage of electricians by scaling training programs and providing just-in-time field support for emerging technologies like EV chargers, solar installations, and data center circuits."
creation_process: "Developed as part of CS 210 Software Project Experience, our team conducted extensive user research with apprenticeship programs and field electricians. We built a React Native mobile app with AI integration for natural language processing and computer vision. The project involved iterative design, user testing with real electricians, and integration of multiple technical components including camera-based verification, step-by-step guidance systems, and real-time feedback mechanisms."
